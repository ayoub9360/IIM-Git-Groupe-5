## 🛠 Installation

__Create a `.env` file and ask for the secrets.__

__Build & launch the project__

```shell
npm i
npm run dev
```

Easy no?

### Workflow

1. Create a new branch from master;
2. Push the branch as often as you want
3. Once you're done, create a pull request based on master and tag it appropriately
4. Once the branch is merged, delete it

### Golden rules

* If you need to share your work before it is done, create the pull request as draft
